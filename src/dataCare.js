        text : "Monstera plants prefer a balanced level of moisture, not too wet nor too dry. Therefore, the best way to check if your plant needs water is to check the top centimetres of the soil. If it's dry, then you can water the plant. Watering once a week during the year is fine. It's better to skip a watering than to water too much. Overwatering can cause the roots to rot.",

Even though a Cactus can hoard moisture in its plant cells to save water for drier climates or drought-like conditions, it certainly can't live with just a little water. However, it doesn’t like being drowned in too much water either. It is best to water a Cactus every month in the growing season, from spring to summer. In the fall and winter it is best to only water the plant once every 3 months.",

        text : "The Areca palm prefers to receive a sip of water once a week. During growing months from spring to summer, you can water the plant regularly, even as much as twice a week but slow down once winter starts as the plants go dormant and retain water for more extended periods. As soon as the potting soil is always slightly moist you are doing well. Make sure that you don't water too often. When there is too much water it can't escape through the roots, which can lead to root rot. This is a well-known phenomenon among indoor plants.",
